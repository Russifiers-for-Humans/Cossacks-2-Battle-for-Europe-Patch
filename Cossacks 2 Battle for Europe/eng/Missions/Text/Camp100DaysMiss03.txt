#Movie05Text01 Soldiers. The insidious enemy desires to invade our lands. The cowardly British want to put the hateful king on our throne and thus outrage out freedom. We are here not to let them do this. 
#Movie05Text02 We'll show them the power of our weapons, we'll kick out those scums, who thought themselves to be soldiers. Long live the Emperor! 

#Movie06Text01 A column of the Prussian forces detected. They move towards us and soon they'll be here.
#Movie06Text02 Are there many of them? Prussian... and what is more marching?
#Movie06Text03 Yes, and quite a number of them. It seems that they've already spotted out avant-guard and now turn to a battle order.
#Movie06Text04 Well, the battle is good. Convey my order to the avant-guard: take the defense near the river-passages and resist the enemy attacks at all costs.
#Movie06Text05 May I proceed?
#Movie06Text06 Yes. Immediately proceed with my order.

#Movie07Text02 What are our casualties?
#Movie07Text03 Losses exist but the soldiers are eager to fight. Everyone waits for the order to attack.
#Movie07Text04 The order will be to attack immediately. First of all it's necessary to attack the Prussian fortifications. The fortress must be taken as soon as possible. Ride hard and deliver my order.
